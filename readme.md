# ArduinoMorse
This is a sketch for arduino which can transmit Morse signals into the air.
Sketch generates a high frequency squarewave.
It contains has a big spectrum of harmonics, so signal will be heard also
on frequencies multiples.

In my case fundamental frequency was around 1.22MHz.

### Beware of squarewave. Take care of signal integrity on your PCBs. Don't make them radiate
